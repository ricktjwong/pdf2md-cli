# pdf2md-CLI

Based on the convert made by https://github.com/jzillmann/pdf-to-markdown.
This started as a CLI project, adding the elements required for the pdf2md along the way, to minimise dependency clashes.

Instructions to run:
<pre>
$ cd [project_folder]
$ node index.js --inputFolderPath=[your input folder path] --outputFolderPath=[your output folder path] --recursive=[true or false]
</pre>
If you are converting recursively on a large number of files you might encounter the error "Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory‚Äù. Instead, run the command
<pre>
$ node --max-old-space-size=4096 index.js --inputFolderPath=[your input folder path] --outputFolderPath=[your output folder path] --recursive=[true or false]
</pre>

Options:
1. Input folder path (should exist)
2. Output folder path (should exist)
3. Recursive - convert all PDFs for folders within folders
